### Session Actions Extension for Ulauncher

This is a fork of a deprecated extention [ulauncher-session-actions](https://github.com/seqizz/ulauncher-session-actions) by [gurkan.in](https://gurkan.in/)

<span style="color: red;"> A hacky session actions extension for the [ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/).

(Formerly known as: 'ulauncher-exit-cinnamon', then I realize hardcoding things doesn't make sense.)

By default, the values it has will work only for Cinnamon DE.
You can configure this for whatever DE/WM you're using. Just check the settings.

Currently supported session actions are:

- Shutdown
- Restart
- Logout
- Suspend
- Hibernate
</span>

I forked this a ported it to ulaunchers API version 2 and converted to python3 (but not much if anything was needed for this part).

Currently supported session actions are:

- Shutdown
- Restart
- Logout
- Suspend
- Hibernate
